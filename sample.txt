Problem 1:

BruteForce: 
check every string with every other string in an array. ==> n^2
compare each char in a string with each char in other string. ==> m^2

Time Complexity: n^2m^2
Space Complexity: O(1)


Using Sorting and Hashmap
sort each string and put it in the hashmap as a key and respective strings as a value.

Time Complexity: nmlog(n) --> n : elements & mlog(n): sorting
Space Complexity: O(mn)  --> for hashmap and sorting the element everytime


Optimal solution with prime product.

take a prime product of each string and put it in the hashmap as a key and respective strings as a value.

Time Complexity: O(mn) --> n : elements & m: largest string present in the array
Space Complexity: O(n)  --> for hashmap
